    "<p> The creative project is about conducting a real-world machine learning project on your own, with everything that is involved. Unlike in the programming projects 1-5, where we gave you all the scaffolding and you just filled in the blanks, you now start from scratch. The past programming projects provide templates for how to do this (and you can reuse part of your code if you wish), and the lectures provide some of the methods you can use. So, this creative project brings realism to how you will use machine learning in the real world.  </p>\n",

    "The task you will work on is classifying texts to human emotions. Through words, humans express feelings, articulate thoughts, and communicate our deepest needs and desires. Language helps us interpret the nuances of joy, sadness, anger, and love, allowing us to connect with others on a deeper level. Are you able to train an ML model that recognizes the human emotions expressed in a piece of text? <b>Please read the project description PDF file carefully and follow the instructions there. Also make sure you write your code and answers to all the questions in this Jupyter Notebook </b> </p>\n",
